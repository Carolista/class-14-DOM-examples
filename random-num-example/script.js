window.addEventListener("load", function () {

  /* CREATE OBJECTS */

  // Generally a good idea to declare objects outside of listeners so they are in scope for everything
  // There are exceptions - like if the element isn't on the page yet because it gets added later
  
  // Object needed for TODO #1

  // Objects needed for TODO #2



  /* CODE TO RUN IMMEDIATELY */

  // Run any code needed to display things on page when it first loads

  // TODO #1 - Add to existing text using new Date object and .toLocaleDateString() method



  /* EVENT LISTENERS */

  // TODO #2 - Add a click event listener for the button to generate a random number
  // Will also need to make the div holding the number visible

  // TODO #3 - Change color of number to yellowgreen if even or coral if odd
  // BONUS: Also change the page background to match (use document.body)

  // TODO #4 - If the random number is evenly divisible by 3, add the spinning class to the button; otherwise remove it

  // TODO #5 - Trigger alert if number is evenly divisible by 5
  // NOTE: Use setTimeout() to deal with race condition; 50ms is plenty of time to delay


  // As part of TODO #2: Take a look at object content using console.log and console.dir
